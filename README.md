## üîç Analytical Questions and Solutions

Below are the ten key questions addressed in the dashboard, along with the **approach**, **visuals**, and **insights** used to answer each.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Which manufacturers are offering the best balance of battery capacity and electric range?

- **Approach**:
  - Scatter Plot (X-axis: Battery Capacity, Y-axis: Electric Range)
  - Color-coded by Manufacturer

- **Visual**:
  - Custom scatter plot with data labels
  - Tooltip to show model name, range, and battery size

- **Insight**:
  - Brands like **Hyundai**, **Tesla**, and **BMW** stand out for offering longer ranges without disproportionately large batteries.
  - Ideal zone (high range, moderate battery) was highlighted in the scatter plot to identify optimal balance.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Does a higher battery capacity always result in a longer electric range?

- **Approach**:
  - Correlation analysis using a Scatter Chart + Trendline
  - R-squared value shown using a calculated field to express correlation strength

- **Visual**:
  - Scatter plot with linear regression line
  - Slicers for brand and battery type for deeper filtering

- **Insight**:
  - Positive correlation exists, but with exceptions.
  - Efficiency plays a role: some models have high capacity but underwhelming range due to poor energy consumption (Wh/km).

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Which brands offer the fastest acceleration (0‚Äì100 km/h), and how does that relate to their torque values?

- **Approach**:
  - Bar Chart showing acceleration times sorted ascending (faster at top)
  - Overlay or tooltip showing Torque values

- **Visual**:
  - Combined Bar + Scatter (dual axis where needed)
  - Matrix view to compare multiple specs side-by-side

- **Insight**:
  - Brands like **Rimac**, **Lucid**, and **Tesla** dominate in acceleration.
  - Generally, higher torque correlates with better acceleration‚Äîbut not always (weight & drivetrain also affect performance).

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Comparison dashboard showing energy efficiency (Wh/km) across manufacturers

- **Approach**:
  - Average Wh/km by manufacturer using Bar Chart
  - Filters: Country, Brand, Battery Type

- **Visual**:
  - Column Chart for energy consumption
  - Conditional formatting to highlight most efficient

- **Insight**:
  - **Hyundai**, **Mini**, and **Renault** showed best Wh/km efficiency.
  - Larger vehicles (e.g., SUVs from Mercedes, Audi) consumed more Wh/km.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze the relationship between total torque and top speed

- **Approach**:
  - Scatter Chart: X-axis = Torque, Y-axis = Top Speed
  - Trendline added to show correlation

- **Visual**:
  - Interactive Scatter Chart
  - Play Axis to see evolution per manufacturer

- **Insight**:
  - No strong linear correlation observed.
  - Some high-torque vehicles are limited in top speed due to safety/efficiency constraints.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Most common battery types and their average performance on key metrics

- **Approach**:
  - Group by Battery Type
  - Calculate averages: Range, Acceleration, Efficiency

- **Visual**:
  - Multi-row cards or Bar Charts
  - Category slicer for battery type

- **Insight**:
  - **Lithium-ion** is most dominant.
  - **Solid-state** batteries showed high efficiency but limited data points.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Which vehicle models deliver the best range with the least battery capacity (i.e., most efficient)?

- **Approach**:
  - Created a new calculated column: `Range per kWh = Electric Range / Battery Capacity`
  - Sorted models by this metric

- **Visual**:
  - Top 10 Most Efficient EVs ‚Äì Bar Chart
  - Data Table with filters (manufacturer, type)

- **Insight**:
  - Models from **Hyundai Ioniq** and **BMW i3** stood out with high range/kWh values.
  - Efficiency is model-dependent, not just brand-dependent.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Are there any outliers in features like torque or acceleration?

- **Approach**:
  - Box plots and Scatter plots with tooltip outlier tags
  - Manual annotations for outliers

- **Visual**:
  - Scatter Plots with labeled outliers
  - Cards showing extreme values

- **Insight**:
  - Example Outliers:
    - **Rimac Nevera**: Extremely fast acceleration
    - **Mercedes EQS SUV**: Exceptionally high torque
    - **Tesla Roadster**: Very high top speed compared to peers

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Which manufacturers have the highest number of battery cells and how does it relate to performance?

- **Approach**:
  - Bar chart of Battery Cells by Manufacturer
  - Side-by-side visuals comparing average top speed, range

- **Visual**:
  - Clustered column chart + KPI cards
  - Filter for battery cell count brackets

- **Insight**:
  - Brands like **Tesla** and **Lucid Motors** use higher cell counts.
  - No direct 1:1 correlation, but higher cell count often supported longer range.

---

### üîü Create a customer comparison dashboard (acceleration, range, top speed)

- **Approach**:
  - Designed user-friendly, filter-driven dashboard
  - Key specs (Acceleration, Range, Top Speed) shown side-by-side

- **Visual**:
  - Multi-filter interface:
    - Brand
    - Battery Type
    - Efficiency
  - Table with slicers and conditional highlights

- **Insight**:
  - Helps end-users shortlist vehicles by their preferences.
  - Effective for performance vs. efficiency trade-off analysis.
